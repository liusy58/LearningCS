???+note "Bash AutoComplete"
    In Bash, use `Tab` to complete arguments or list all available commands and `ctrl-r` to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press `ctrl-r` repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press Enter to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).
